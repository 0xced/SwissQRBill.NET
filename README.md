# Swiss QR Bill for .NET

Open-source .NET library to generate Swiss QR bills (jointly developed with the [Java version](https://github.com/manuelbl/SwissQRBill)).

Try it yourself and [create a QR bill](https://www.codecrete.net/qrbill). 

## Introduction

The Swiss QR bill is the new QR code based payment format that will replace the current payment slip starting at 30 June, 2020. The new payment slip will in most cases be sent electronically. But it can still be printed at the bottom of an invoice or added to the invoice on a separate sheet. The payer scans the QR code with his/her mobile banking app to initiate the payment. The payment just needs to be confirmed.

The invoicing party can easily synchronize the received payment with the accounts-receivable accounting as the payment comes with a full set of data including the reference number used on the invoice. The Swiss QR bill is convenient for the payer and payee.
